# Cavern

A 2D adventure game made with Lua and LÖVE

## About this project

Cavern is an open-source game written in Lua utilizing the game framework [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). This game was created to provide LÖVE developers with a fully completed project to refer to when creating their own games.

## Running the game

Download or clone this repo, and then run the project with LÖVE, which can be downloaded [here](https://love2d.org/). The game will only work properly with versions 11.0 or later. The easiest way to run a project with LÖVE is to drag the project folder onto a LÖVE application shortcut.

## License

Each folder for this project (maps, music, sounds, source, and sprites) contains its own LICENSE.txt file. All code (found in
the "source" directory) is under the MIT license, meaning you can use the code for any purpose without restriction. The assets
(maps, music, sounds, and sprites) are under the BY-NC-ND 4.0 license, which requires attribution, denies use for commercial
projects, and prevents modification of those assets.

Simply put, you can use the code however you want, but the assets (art, music, etc.) have restrictions in place. The
project is set up like this to prevent people from downloading the full game and selling it as their own. At the same time,
developers can still use the code in their own projects.
