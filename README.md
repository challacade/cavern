# Cavern

A 2D adventure game made with Lua and LÖVE

## About this project

Cavern is an open-source game written in Lua utilizing the game framework [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). This game was created to provide LÖVE developers with a fully completed project to refer to when creating their own games.

## Running the game

Download or clone this repo, and then run the project with LÖVE, which can be downloaded [here](https://love2d.org/). The game will only work properly with versions 11.0 or later. The easiest way to run a project with LÖVE is to drag the project folder onto a LÖVE application shortcut.
